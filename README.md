# Natural-Language-Tool-Kit-Practice
This repository is a part of my practice with the APIs of Natural Language Processing </br>
The original source of the chapters and codes used can be found here: https://www.nltk.org/book/ </br>
This is work in progress. </br> </br> I am looking to collaborate on open source projects, so feel free to reach out if you have any project ideas on NLP or other AI applications.
